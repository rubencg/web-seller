## Product list and description page to sell our stuff

I wanted to create a simple site to show the products I was selling when moving out, but didn't want to use facebook marketplace yet cause I wanted to show them to friends first. (Also to practice a bit react)

So I created this site to showcase them.
### Running the site

```
npm install

npm start
```

### Demo
